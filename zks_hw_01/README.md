## Instructions
**To run this project you need to:**

1) Find an appropriate Selenium WebDriver for your Operating system and browser (e. g. for Mozilla Firefox the drivers 
are located here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and put it to the `drivers/` directory in this project.
1) Change the `serenity.properties/` file to use appropriate browser.
1) If you have chosen different browser than Firefox, you need to change the org.seleniumhq.selenium dependency in pom.xml to the one that you want to use.

Then you should be able to run the tests (preferably in IDEA with Java 8).
